## Project #1: Data-Driven Feature Tracking for Aerial Imagery 

**Core Objective:**
- Adapt and apply event camera-based feature tracking methods to aerial imagery for accurate camera position estimation.

**Main Components:**
*Feature Detection System*
- Implement Messikommer's 2023 CVPR feature tracking approach
- Modify the event camera technique for aerial image analysis

*Feature Tracking*
- Create continuous feature tracks across image sequences
- Utilize frame attention for improved track consistency

*3D Reconstruction*
- Convert feature tracks into Structure-from-Motion (SfM) inputs
- Use COLMAP/BA4S to determine camera positions
- Validate accuracy of 3D position estimates

**Required Outputs:**
- Documented methodology and findings
- Performance metrics
- Implementation code with documentation
- Quality assessment of camera position estimates

This project essentially aims to bridge event camera tracking techniques with traditional aerial photography to achieve more reliable camera position estimation. You'll be working with both event and RGB camera data, with the main challenge being the adaptation of Messikommer's event-based approach to aerial imagery.
